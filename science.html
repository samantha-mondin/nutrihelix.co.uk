                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p><br>Genetics plays a crucial role in nutrition as it can impact how individuals metabolise and utilise various nutrients, ultimately affecting their overall health and disease risk. Research shows that a one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition advice is often ineffective due to the significant individual differences among people, mainly explained by their unique DNA. <br>Genetic variations can impact an individual's ability to absorb certain nutrients, their sensitivity to specific food components, and their overall response to dietary interventions. Understanding an individual's unique genetic makeup can provide important insights into how an individual's unique genetic makeup may influence their response to different nutrients and dietary components, in this way identifying areas of nutrient deficiencies, requirements, food intolerances, and disease allowing for more targeted and personalised nutrition recommendations that can optimise individualâ€™s health. </br><br></p>

                    <p><br>Nutrigenetics testing can provide valuable insights into how an individual's genes and diet interact to affect their health, but there are limitations to its accuracy due to the complexity of relationships between genetics and nutrition/health. While some genetic variations have been well-studied and have established associations with specific health outcomes or nutritional needs, other genetic variations have more complex or uncertain relationships with nutrition and health.<br><br>This is because many other factors beyond genetics (such as lifestyle, environment, and microbiome) can influence individual's body responds to different nutrients and dietary components. However, despite these limitations, <b>nutrigenomics testing can still provide very important and useful insights that can allow the development of personalised nutrition recommendations than can help you optimising your health.</b><br><br> This is why, to overcome these limitations, when pursuing nutrigenomics testing it's very important to rely on reputable testing provider and specialised healthcare professional or genetic counsellor that can help you to interpret understand your DNA test results in the context of other health and lifestyle factors. They will help you to understand the potential benefits and limitations of this type of testing at the same time ensuring the accuracy and reliability of nutrigenomics testing. <br><br></p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p><br>Genetic tests in nutrition analyze only variations in modifier/metabolic genes, which are involved in the metabolism and processing of nutrients and dietary components. These tests <u><b>do not</u></b> analyse disease risk genes that can predict specific disease outcomes or if an individual is at risk for a particular disease.<br><br>However, since diet and nutrition represent an important modifiable risk factor that can generally influence the risk of developing several chronic diseases such as CVD, obesity, diabetes, and cancer, genetic tests in nutrition can provide valuable information on how the interaction between our genes and diet can influence and modify our general disease risk.<br><br>It is also important to note that genetics and diet are just some of the factors that contributes to disease risk, and other lifestyle and environmental factors such exercise also play a role. Therefore, nutrigenomics testing cannot be considered a predictor of disease outcomes. However, it can be used to develop a comprehensive plan for disease prevention and management based on an individual's needs and risk factors.<br><br></p>

                    <p><br>The nutrigenomics testing process typically involves an initial consultation with one of our highly specialised nutritionists to discuss your health goals, concerns, and family medical history, and to understand the potential benefits and limitations of nutrigenomics testing. <br><br>This can also be done online by completing the provided forms and questionnaires. A DNA sample is then collected through a saliva sample, which is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Once your results are available, you will receive a report that provides information on your genetic variations and how they may impact your nutrition and health. This report may include personalised nutrition recommendations based on your genetic profile. <br><br>At NutriHelix, we also offer the option to request counselling with our specialised healthcare professionals that will help you to interpret the results of your nutrigenomics testing in the context of your overall health and lifestyle factors. This step is essential to ensure you understand the potential benefits and limitations of this type of testing, while ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results.<br><br></p>
